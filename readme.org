* Fat Free Evil Emacs Config
** Motivation
** Installing
You can clone this repository directly to ~/.emacs.d/ directory, but I presonally like to keep my emacs config in code directory and link files with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html][stow]].
This way I can keep .gitingore empty, since config files will be linked.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git@github.com:firstrow/fat-free-evil.git
mkdir ~/.emacs.d
stow -t ~/.emacs.d/ .
#+END_SRC
